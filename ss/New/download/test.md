WA Carpet Cleaning commercial division is waiting to impress your customers. Our service utilises best carpet cleaning equipment and training in Perth. Carpet cleaning is an investment and our service is all about value for your money.

Your commercial customers expect to walk into a clean and presented office, hotel or shop and we will help you achieve this with our state of the art process of carpet cleaning. Perth commercial carpets have been mistreated by untrained and non passionate carpet cleaners. Many of our customers have been delighted to find out that instead of replacing their carpets, we have a system that can restore most neglected carpets to look presentable again at a very competitive price.

Have you ever wondered why carpets get dirty quickly? The most common reason is the way the carpets have been cleaned.

Still confused? Most carpet cleaners in Perth are untrained and most commercial carpet cleaning companies employ the cheapest labour they can.

The process most commonly used in the commercial environment is to use a portable carpet cleaning machine and place a very high alkaline detergent in the back of the machine which is sticky. When the carpet dries and the dust in the air is pushed onto the sticky carpet which cannot be vacuumed out during maintenance nightly vacuuming.

The other reason is that the machine and equipment has not been set up in the right way and the carpet takes too long to dry and the dirt left in the carpet wicks back up to the surface with the sticky detergent making the carpet look dirty still.

Our commercial carpet cleaning maintenance process eliminates this by a thorough pre vacuum, with the best vacuum to remove and filter the finest of dust. We then use a detergent that dries to a crystalline state that is not sticky but can be vacuumed out easily and oxygen boosters can be added to help remove organic and tannin based stains caused by tea, coffee, blood, vomit and urine stains.
